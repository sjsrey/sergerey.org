I am looking forward to participating in the [Sustainable Urban Planning Research Symposium](https://cps.gwu.edu/gws-sustainable-urban-planning-research-symposium) at George Washington University which is examining applications of regional modeling and spatial analysis in urban planning.

I will be presenting our work on developing new spatial and saptiotemporal methods as part of [PySAL](Http://PySAL.org), and discussing how these have been used in applied research on economic development, housing markets and segregation.
