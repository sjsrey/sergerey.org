Title: PySAL 1.8 Released
Date: 2014-07-25
Tags: pysal


We normally ship [PySAL][pysal] on a six-month release cycle, once at the end of January and again the end of July. This year due to travel schedules (it is summer after all) we shipped 1.8 one week early. 

A lot of work on the testing infrastructure, bug fixes and optimizations. One new [contrib  module][contrib] that provides for interaction between  PySAL and [clusterpy][cp].
