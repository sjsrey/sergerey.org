Title: More Big Tents, Less Hubris

This year's SciPy conference was fantastic.

While overall I thought the conference was the best one I've been to yet, there were a couple of undercurrents that I could not really grok.

I've been attending SciPy since 2003 and some of the comments that came out after the conference this year certainly resonated with me. One of the chief sore spots was that SciPy felt cliquish to the new comers. 

I understand this perspective as I definitely felt it my first few SciPys. At the same time my experience in this community tells me that this is not due to a concerted effort by the "insiders" to keep the circle tight and closed to newcomers. If anything, the organizers I have worked with the past few years put incredible energy into making the meeitng as inclusive as possible. 

What I think is behind this experience is the following:

- getting to know people in a new community takes time
- the number of cliques tends to grow with the size of a meeting
- scipy has grown in recent years.


The second undercurrent relates to the sometimes dissmissive view of social science that permeats the conference. This was reflected in the comments of Greg Wilson when he pleaded for more humility in the scientific computing community in trying to learn from the social sciences.



The final undercurrent is both a strength and a weakness of the community. The tools, packages, ideas and people who are present at SciPy are often at the cutting edge of scientific computing. There is an abundance of excitement about recent developments and it is easy to get caught up in the latest and greatest. The cost of this is that I think we as a community too easily turn a blind eye to the stumbling blocks that a newcomer encounters when trying to get many of these tools setup so they can learn them. Telling people who have Macs that they should get a Linux laptop to use Docker is really a non-starter. The pool of future scientists, open source contributers, and talent lives in a heterogenous computing world. Having to spend most of the alloted time in a workshop just getting the dependencies installed (and maybe not completely at that) can lead to frustration on the part of the newcomer and the potential loss of a new contributor.

In one workshop I sat next to such a newcommer who joked with me that the instructions for the workshop should have read:

1. Install dependencies, A, B, C, D, E
2. Tell us how you did that
