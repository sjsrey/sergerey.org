[![Panel][1]

(Source: [@gespindav][2])

Last week I attended the [Second International Conference on CyberGIS and Geodesign](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/events/cybergis14/). We presented a few talks on our work related to the CyberGIS project, and one of the highlights for me was a very engaging panel with old friends [Mark Gahegan][mark], [May Yuan][may],  [Dawn Wright][dawn] and [Shaowen Wang] as emcee.
