[Services][wikipedias] are one of the most under appreciated, and therefore underutilized, aspects of OS X. Every so often I am reminded how helpful these things can be.

 The problem of course, is that the reminders seem like [Black Swan effects][wikipedia], so remembering that I have set them up in the first place becomes a problem. I think that is something that  fixed only when one inculcates their use in a regular fashion. Sort of like muscle memory for the brain.

As most of my writing starts in [Markdown][daringfireball], I find that the [Markdown Services][brettterpstrams] by one [Brett Terpstra][brettterpstra] can be a major productivity booster.
